# This is a placeholder for the 3D car model file
# In production, you would place actual GLTF/GLB 3D car models here
# 
# Recommended sources for car models:
# 1. Sketchfab (https://sketchfab.com) - High-quality automotive models
# 2. TurboSquid (https://www.turbosquid.com) - Professional 3D models
# 3. CGTrader (https://www.cgtrader.com) - Marketplace for 3D models
# 4. Free3D (https://free3d.com) - Free 3D models
#
# Model Requirements:
# - Format: GLTF 2.0 (.glb preferred for single file)
# - Size: Under 10MB for web performance
# - Compression: Use DRACO compression for smaller file sizes
# - Materials: PBR materials with proper textures
# - Optimization: Low-poly models optimized for real-time rendering
#
# File naming convention:
# - generic-car.glb (fallback model)
# - sedan-2024.glb (specific vehicle models)
# - suv-luxury.glb (category-based models)
#
# This placeholder file should be replaced with actual 3D models
